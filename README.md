# Cardioids

My life-long love story continues with this one made with Rust and WebAssembly.

For the moment it's still pretty basic but I might add some more to it later on.

## Building

To build this you'll need to install [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/) and run this command in the root directory :

```sh
$ wasm-pack build --target web
```

You then just need to serve the root directory.
